/**
 * THE DRIFT LOCK. On an empty database, the core's history plus this module's
 * builds the whole schema — and `diff` then has nothing left to say.
 *
 * A missing column here is not a test failure in the abstract: it is an
 * installation whose `doctrine:migrations:diff` — the command it runs for the
 * entities IT writes — hands it SQL for tables this module owns.
 *
 * `--namespace` is passed deliberately and always. With several namespaces
 * registered the command's default target is whichever the configuration hands
 * back first, so a diff run without it can write a version for this module's
 * entities into somebody else's directory.
 *
 * `--allow-empty-diff` turns "nothing to do" from a thrown NoChangesDetected
 * into exit 0 with the message, which is the assertion this test wants.
 *
